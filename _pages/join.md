## Do you have what it takes?

We are looking for motivated individuals who are able to work in a fast-paced environment with a flat structure.

Please email all applications to hr@gao-group.com.

Applications must be accompanied _**at the very least**_ by:-
1. A PDF copy of your resume. (Word docs are less likely to be opened immediately and might be ignored.)
2. An unofficial school transcript of recent grades.

Applicants that are multi-lingual and that have a good command of Mandarin will be looked upon favorably.  If you are able to spot any grammatical and or spelling mistakes in our website _**AND**_ give a well-written alternative to help us better communicate our message, we will definitely take your attention to detail into consideration.

### Perks working at GAO

* A well stocked pantry with unlimited drinks enough to quench your thirst (soda, beer, coffee - drip, espresso, instant, tea - dozens of varieties, etc) and great food (beef steaks, salmon, korean pork bbq) that makes visitors think we might be Rosina Leckermaul in disguise.
* We welcome pets! (No pet snakes please.)
* The coolest bosses.

### Some last words of advice...

* Do not send Word files of your resume.  Formatting on Macs and Windows are different sometimes and if your resume or CV is badly formatted on print, it will just look unprofessional.  Furthermore, there are countless times we have received Word files with track changes on.  How embarassing!
* Please limit your resume to 1 page.  We have yet to meet any candidate that is so outstanding but yet unable to express their great qualifications within 1 page.
* Pick a standard and consistent format.  We do not have time to decipher complex artwork.
* Describe your experiences with specificity and strong action verbs and include how you performed tasks not just what you did.
* Use keywords in your resume. Know what words are relevant to the industry or position you are applying for.
