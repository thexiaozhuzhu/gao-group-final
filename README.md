### Why Jekyll? 
#### Simplicity
Jekyll strips everything down to the bare minimum, eliminating a lot of complexity:

##### No database
Unlike WordPress and other content management systems (CMS), Jekyll doesn’t have a database. All posts and pages are converted to static HTML prior to publication. This is great for loading speed because no database calls are made when a page is loaded.

##### No CMS
Simply write all of your content in Markdown, and Jekyll will run it through templates to generate your static website. GitHub can serve as a CMS if needed because you can edit content on it.

##### Fast
Jekyll is fast because, being stripped down and without a database, you’re just serving up static pages. My base theme, Jekyll Now, makes only three HTTP requests — including the profile picture and social icons!

#### Minimal
Your Jekyll website will include absolutely no functionality or features that you aren’t using.

#### Design control
Spend less time wrestling with complex templates written by other people, and more time creating your own theme or customizing an uncomplicated base theme.

#### Security
The vast majority of vulnerabilities that affect platforms like WordPress don’t exist because Jekyll has no CMS, database or PHP. So, you don’t have to spend as much time installing security updates.

#### Convenient hosting
Convenient if you already use GitHub, that is. GitHub Pages will build and host your Jekyll website at no charge, while simultaneously handling version control.
